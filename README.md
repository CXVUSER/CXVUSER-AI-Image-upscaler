# GFPGAN-ncnn-vulkan :construction:

Ncnn with Vulkan implementation of **GFPGAN aims at developing Practical Algorithms for Real-world Face Restoration**

## :construction: Important Note :construction:
This project still under heavy development and may not work all the time, until I reach certain stability with or without Vulkan I don't release or remove this section

## :construction: Model support :construction:

1. GFPGANCleanv1-NoCE-C2

### TODO: :bookmark_tabs:
- [x] Support ncnn-vulkan
- [ ] Convert pth->onnx->ncnn stably without error 
- [ ] Model with colorization
